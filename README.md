# **House Price Prediction Model**

This project is designed to predict housing prices based on various factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes. The model uses **machine learning** algorithms to provide real-time predictions for real-estate pricing. This end-to-end solution was developed using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and deployed with **Flask** on **Heroku**.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The model predicts house prices based on input features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, scales numerical features, and encodes categorical data effectively.
- **Modeling**: Uses **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** for accurate predictions.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on **Heroku** using **Flask**, allowing users to interact with the model via a web interface.
